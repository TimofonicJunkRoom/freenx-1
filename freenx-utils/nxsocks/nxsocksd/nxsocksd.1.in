nxsocksd \- user specific SOCKS5 daemon

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nxsocksd
is a lightweight SOCKS5 daemon. It is intended to be run by the user
who wants to use the SOCKS service and facilitates the use of an
.B ssh
TCP port redirection to run the SOCKS protocol over.
.B nxsocksd
is useful in situations where the user has access to a host with less
restricted connectivity than his own machine, or where the user\'s
own machine is on an insecure network and all connections should be
encrypted.
.B nxsocksd
implements all documented commands, the address types
.I IPv4 Address
and
.I Domain Name
(for domain names that resolve to IPv4 addresses) and the
authentication methods
.I No Authentication
and
.IR "Username/Password" .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-p " port"
Port to listen on for connections. On a multi-user system, each user
has to specify his own port instead of relying on the standard port.
Default is 1080, nonetheless.
.TP
.BI \-a " accepthost"
Specify that connections are only accepted from this host.
.ie '\*N'1' This option must be present.
.el Default: no restriction.
It is possible to specify more than one allowed host, they have to be
separated with a comma (and nothing else). Hosts are given either as
IP address or as resolvable name.
.TP
.BI \-u " udphost"
Specify that UDP packets to be relayed come from this host instead of
the default (the connecting host). Why this violation of RFC 1928 is
necessary is explained below under "Usage".
.if '\*N'1' This option must be present.
It is possible to specify more than one host.
.TP
.BI \-i " identuser"
Specify that for each incoming connection an
.B identd
query will be made and the connection rejected if it does not resolve
to the given user name. Note that
.B identd
is not a reliable authentication service.
.TP
.BI \-U " authuser"
Specify that
.I Username/Password
authentication be used with the given user name. The password is read
from standard input.
.ie '\*N'1' This option must be present.
.el Without this option, no authentication is requested from clients.
.if '\*D'1' \{\
.TP
.BI \-d " debuglevel"
Specify the amount of tracing output. See the source for the meaning
of the numbers.\}
.SH USAGE
The intended usage for running SOCKS5 over an
.B ssh
connection is as follows:
.PP
.nf
\fCssh -L1080:relayhost:12345 relayhost\\
.br
 "nxsocksd -p12345 -arelayhost -umyhost -Ufred"\fP
.fi
.PP
where
.I relayhost
is the host where
.B nxsocksd
runs and
.I myhost
is the client's host. Note the coincidence of the host name and port
number arguments. After this connection is established,
.I myhost
can be used as its own SOCKS5 server. The SOCKS connections, and
therefore all TCP data, will be encrypted. UDP data is not sent over
the encrypted SOCKS connection and is not encrypted; it goes directly
from
.I myhost
to
.IR relayhost ,
while the corresponding SOCKS connection seems to come from
.I relayhost
itself. This is the reason why a regular SOCKS5 server can not be used
for UDP in this situation (and the original incentive for writing
.BR nxsocksd ).
The SOCKS clients will use password authentication as user
.IR fred.
The password to use is read from standard input.
Neither user name nor password need to coincide with the real user
name and password on any of the machines involved.
.PP
.B nxsocksd
terminates when it encounters EOF on standard input. All other input
on stdin is ignored. If the password should be read from a file
instead of standard input, the proper way of invocation is
.PP
.nf
\fCcat ~/.socks-password - |\\
 ssh -L1080:relayhost:12345 relayhost\\
.br
 "nxsocksd -p12345 -arelayhost -umyhost -Ufred"\fP
.fi
.PP
.B nxsocksd
does not spawn any child processes,
.if '\*F'1' \{\
except for the extended
.B ping
and
.B traceroute
commands, \}
it does not detach from the
controlling terminal and does produce output on the standard output
and error channels.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Messages about new connections, operating parameters and statistics
are printed on standard output. Messages about connection failures are
printed on standard error.
.if '\*D'1' \{\
Depending on the
.B \-d
argument, more tracing is printed on standard output. \}
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR ssh (1),
.BR "RFC 1928:" " SOCKS Protocol Version 5"
.SH BUGS
Most of the permission and sanity checks described in RFC 1928 are not
implemented. This may be considered a feature.
.PP
Nonblocking I/O is used where applicable. On some systems, where
nonblocking I/O does not work, new connections in progress will
temporarily suspend data transfer on existing connections. The same
applies to diagnostic output if the standard output and standard error
channels run on a socket or pipe which can block.
.PP
.B nxsocksd
does not fully support multi-homed servers. Support for multi-homed
clients may depend on the client's SOCKS library.
.PP
UDP relaying does not work in the following case:
Multiple or no addresses are given with the
.BI \-u
argument, and the client does not send any packets (it only receives),
and the client binds its socket to address 0.
.PP
When multiple addresses are given with the
.BI \-u
argument, UDP relaying between those hosts does or does not work,
depending on the exact sequence of packets. It is
assumed that all allowed clients connect to each other directly.
.PP
There should be a more elegant method of killing an
.B nxsocksd
started via
.B ssh
than the EOF handling.
.SH NOTES
The
.B ping
and
.B traceroute
utilities do not work with SOCKS because they use the ICMP protocol.
The reference implementation SOCKS
daemon by NEC includes undocumented commands for these applications.
.ie '\*F'1' \{\
.B nxsocksd
supports these by calling the
.B ping
or
.B traceroute
programs on the host where it runs. \}
.el \{\
These are not supported by this configuration of
.BR nxsocksd . \}
