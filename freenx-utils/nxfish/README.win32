There is now also a windows version available.

You need to install perl and create a start bat like:

@start perl C:\\PATH\\TO\\nx-fishsrv-win32.pl "C:\\Folder\\Shared\\" "" "<port>"

You also need to install file to C:\\Programme\\GnuWin32\\bin\file.exe.

Or tweak the path in nx-fishsrv-win32.pl.

Enjoy!
