This program was adapted for usage by NX by Fabian Franz.

If the user nxsocksd is used, connections are restricted to localhost and certain ports.
--------
This is a small SOCKS5 server. While the usual "socksd" runs as a
system service, perhaps on a firewall machine with no users, this one
is intended to be run by users themselves.

There are two situations where this is useful:

1. User has access to a machine with less restricted connectivity than
the machine he works on.

2. User is on an insecure network and wants all network traffic to be
enrypted using "ssh", and has access to a machine running "sshd" on a
more secure network. "nxsocksd" contains special provisions for this
situation.

More information on how to run "nxsocksd" is in the man page.

Installation: sh ./configure; make; make install.
configure takes additional arguments --enable-debug, --enable-norelax
and --with-socks5. configure --help for more info.

This program can itself use SOCKS, although I haven't tested that
option.

Developed on Linux 2.0, tested also on HPUX 10, AIX 4.1, Solaris 2.6.
