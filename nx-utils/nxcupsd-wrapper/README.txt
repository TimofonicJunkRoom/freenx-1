To use this install nxcupsd-wrapper somewhere and point the linux nxclient NX 2.1.0 to it.

The wrapper enables usage with client CUPS v1.2 and also enables the seamless and download mode
of the printer support of FreeNX 0.6.1-devel.

Note: You can only run one session with local cupsds enabled at a time.
      This is a limitation of the commercial nxclient.
