Okay, here we go.

We need:

- KDE 3.5.5 or install kio_nxfish ourselves using the provided sources.
- ssh access to the nx server we want to use nxfish on.
- netpipes installed on the client computer.

Now we do:

Client:
	- Start nx session
	- Look into ~/.nx/S-<yoursession>/options for the right cookie.

	- Start:
	
	$ ./nx-fishsrv.sh <the directory you want to share> - <some port>
	Please provide password: <cookie>
	Starting nx-fishsrv.pl ...

	Note:
	   
	   You will have complete access from the remote session to the directory 
	   that you share.

	   It should not contain any symlinks to things you don't want to share.

	   Perhaps a symlink detection is later built into nx-fishrv.pl.

Server:
	- Install nxfish to /usr/bin or somewhere else in your PATH.
	- Make sure that (Free)NX does export NXSESSIONID.

	  You might need to use a custom startkde script, where you export it yourself using something
	  like:

	  for i in $( echo $HOME/.nx/C-*$(echo $DISPLAY | cut -d: -f2)-* | tr ' ' '\n' )
	  do
	      [ -f "$i/pids/agent" ] && break
	  done
	  export NXSESSIONID=$i

	- Just open konqueror and browse to nxfish:/

	- Done :)

That's it folk.

Please enjoy.
