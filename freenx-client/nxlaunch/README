  nxlaunch: A GTK+ NX client.

  Seb James. September 2007. seb@esfnet.co.uk

Nxlaunch uses a program called nxcl (distributed separately) to
negotiate the NX connection. Nxlaunch sends settings via dbus to
nxcl so that it can then negotiate the correct sort of NX session
for you. 

nxcl is distributed separately with the nxcl library.

It would be quite possible to write a GTK client which links directly
to the nxcl library, but that is left as a further exercise for
someone.

Building:

If you checked out the svn code, you need to do:

autoreconf -is

then:

./configure [--enable-debug-output]
make
make install
