This annoucement is inspired by the "Marketing for Geeks" guide, which 
was recently showcasted by Aaron and Waldo at akademy 2005, the KDE 
contributor conference in Malaga/Spain. 


Malaga, 30th August, aKademy 2005 conference.

The FreeNX Developer Team is proud to release a new version of FreeNX,
the remote desktop access software. 

* FreeNX is known to work on Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris. 
* FreeNX provides efficient access to remote applications with a 
  graphical user interface (GUI). 
* FreeNX works well even over dialup modem links. 
* FreeNX connects client computers to Linux or Unix GUI applications
  as well as to MS Windows. 
* FreeNX works very well with the NoMachine NX Client (available for 
  Linux, Windows and Solaris). 
  


What FreeNX can do for different users -- some real world use cases:
====================================================================

* a travelling salesman can access his own desktop (at home or at his
  office) from the hotel room, using a modem (or better) connection.

* a helpdesk technician can display any GUI application of a LAN user
  to his own screen and help to properly set up its configuration or
  troubleshoot it.

* a university system administrator can set up a cost efficient
  Linux Desktop Application Server for students to connect to from
  classes or from home.

* a KDE developer can showcase his latest code to co-maintainers and
  usability experts in action without them needing to compile it by
  themselves.

* an IT consultancy company can offer its customers more flexible
  scenarios when planning and implementing migrations from MS Windows
  to Linux. 


What parts FreeNX is composed of:
=================================

The FreeNX remote desktop server software *requires* the NX Core 
components developed by NoMachine.com who have released that source
code under the GPL license.

The NoMachine source code needs to be compiled for your platform by 
yourself or by your Linux distribution so that FreeNX can work. 
NoMachine Core NX components are available in version 1.4.0 or 1.5.0. 
We recommend to use 1.5.0 for better performance and more features. 

NoMachine also offer a commercial package of ready-made NX server 
software for several OS platforms, including support and several 
add-ons useful for enterprise level installations.


What improvements this release brings to current FreeNX users:
==============================================================

* it now sports the most easy installation we ever had
* it now works better and faster than ever, and is more colorful
* it now has a resizable remote desktop
* it now has a fast single application mode
* it now supports truecolor remote MS Windows sessions
* it now can be installed without having root privileges
* it is now easier to troubleshoot in case of problems
* it now better supports big corporate environments
* it contains many fixes for known bugs
* it is more stable than previous releases
* it has been improved on security


And last but not least:

* FreeNX 0.4.5 ships with the first official FreeNX background picture
  (useful as a wallpaper)


What FreeNX users at "aKademy" had to say this about the release:
=================================================================

KDE/Konqueror developer Daniel Teske says: "It was easy to install, 
easy to use and it is blazingly fast. I was working here from Spain 
on my home machine in Germany without any problems."

Martin Konold (architect of the Kolab groupware server which already 
successfully replaced several MS Exchange installations) told us this,
after having seen a preview of NX4MyHome: "I am deeply impressed by 
the ease of use and the performance of NX4Myhome. FreeNX manages to 
do the impossible: it even speeds up command line operations by a 
factor of three or more while offering the same security as ssh with 
full suspend and resume functionality."


Now let us give you some details about the new release:


Easiest installation ever
-------------------------

The "nxsetup" program of FreeNX 0.4.5 now...
  ...works by default in an interactive way
  ...checks for a correct configuration 
  ...conducts automatic self-tests 
  ...offers a help system.

Important changes compared to previous releases:

* since "nxsetup" is now interactive, we added an "--auto" commandline 
  parameter to support the old behaviour you may be accustomed to;
* since "nxsetup" now uses the NoMachine key by default, the user 
  installing FreeNX has to confirm its use;
* since "nxsetup" now checks for a correct configuration file, there is 
  a "--ignore-errors" commandline parameter to continue nxsetup even 
  if the check fails;
* since "nxsetup" now runs an automatic self-test, it also reminds the 
  user of some common pitfalls.


Better, faster, and more colorful (NX 1.5.0)
--------------------------------------------

FreeNX 0.4.5 has full support for the most important features 
introduced into the 1.5.0 NoMachine Core NX components (not working
with the 1.4.0 version):

* your full remote desktop is now resizable if displayed in windowed 
  mode.  Just drag the borders with the mouse to change its size.
* your full remote desktop can now easily toggled between windowed and
  fullscreen  mode. Just press the key combination [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[f].
* your remote single application windows now supports the same fast
  speed that the full remote desktop always had. To use this feature...
    ...on the FreeNX-0.4.5 server set ENABLE_ROOTLESS_MODE="1" in the 
       "node.conf" configuration file, and
    ...in the NoMachine NX Client follow these steps:
       --> click "Configure..."
       --> select the "General" tab
       --> locate and go to the "Desktop" box (middle box)
       --> select "Unix" and "Custom" session type
       --> click "Settings..."
       --> enable "Run the following command" radio button
       --> type in the application's startup command, click "OK" twice
           and login. 
* your remote access to Windows Terminal Server sessions can now be run
  in "Truecolor" mode. Just use the 1.5.0 version of the NoMachine NX 
  Client and follow these steps to set it up:
       --> click "Configure..."
       --> select the "General" tab
       --> locate and go to the "Desktop" box (middle box)
       --> select the "Windows" session type 
       --> locate and go to the "Display" box (bottom box)
       --> select "Use custom settings"
       --> click "Modify..."
       --> locate and go to the "Allowed colors" box (top box)
       --> move the slider to the "16M" position


Install FreeNX without root privileges (usermode installation)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine the following scenario:

* you have a user account on a Linux machine where you can run a KDE
  desktop if you sit in front of it
* you can remotely access the machine via an SSH login in shell-only
  mode
* you do not possess root privileges on the machine, and therefor you
  cannot install the standard FreeNX server.

FreeNX-0.4.5 now supports a "usermode" installation via remote SSH 
access into your home directory. 

FreeNX Development Team member Thorsten Sandfuchs has explained the
steps to follow in detail in a separate HOWTO. It is available from:

   http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=FreeNX_Howto

The FreeNX Development Team plans to ship ready-made binary packages
of this option (probably named "NX4MyHome") which support a more easy
mode of installation as soon as all tests are finished. For now you 
have to follow the instructions supplied by the link above.


Easier troubleshooting in case of problems
------------------------------------------

In the past FreeNX users experienced several problem scenarios that 
came up over and over again. There are many different distributions
shipping FreeNX packaged by them, each doing things a bit different. 
But we can't give detailed "test this" and "do that" instructions 
without knowing a lot about the environment of a user experiencing
problems with the FreeNX package provided by his distro.

For example starting up nxagent over a ssh -X connection to test if 
the basic functionality works can now be done with this simple command:

   nxserver --agent :1000

instead of formerly:

   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/nxlibs/dir /path/to/nxagent :1000

It should now be a lot easier to give advice in case of problems.


Better support for big corporate environments
---------------------------------------------

Thanks to help and patches of Google and Cisco employees, FreeNX now 
does work also in environments where there are 1000 users or more.

The previous authentications code suffered from the flaw that it did
retrieve the whole passwd database and grep through it to find a user. 
Now it directly queries for the information needed using getent.


Lots of bugfixes, more stability and improved security
------------------------------------------------------

This release contains several bugfixes:

* Fixed support for CUPS forwarding
* Fixed resume with the 1.5.0 NoMachine NX Client

Stability has been increased in the following fields:

* Reconnection support (Yes, again)

Security issues / concerns have been fixed regarding the following topics:

* Certain passwords for VNC and RDP type session under certain 
  conditions were visible via `ps aux`. All known cases are fixed.
* Passwords are no longer shown in log files or re-transmitted to the 
  client.
* ${USER_FAKE_HOME}/.nx is now protected against access by other users.
* The NX client is no longer able to overwrite parameters set by the 
  NX server.
 

First official FreeNX background picture
----------------------------------------

This release for the first time ships a PNG graphic file, meant to be 
used as a desktop wallpaper. You can now show your appreciation for 
FreeNX by using it for at least one of your desktops as a background. 
Whenever you show off FreeNX, be sure to use it and spread the word!
