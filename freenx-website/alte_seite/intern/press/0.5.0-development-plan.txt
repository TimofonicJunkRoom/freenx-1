30th August 2005, Malaga, aKademy Conference.

The FreeNX team is proud to present the development plan for the 0.5.0 release of FreeNX.

First of all:

Its ready when its ready.

Second:

It won't be released until:
	- The documentation is finished
	- The website is in good state, which can be marketed.
	- Its ready ;-)

There will however be several development snapshots to keep up the "release often and early" cycle.

Plans for 0.5.0 include the rewrite of the Suspend / Resume / Session keep up management with the first priority on _stability_.

0.5.0 also will only support the 1.5.0 backend and get lots of cleanup.

Also planned is the integration of several features, like nxfish, and a fully featured OSS client.
